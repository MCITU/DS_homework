package Critical_section

/*
have a FIFO queue so we grants access to each node that wants to enter
have print statements to indicate that a node is inside the critical section
	or write to a database log of whom have entered
only one node should be able to enter at a time - bool [in use/ not in use]
every node that request access should get in at some point hence the queue
